- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Animation**: CSS Transforms & Keyframes
- **Performance**: Optimized for 60 FPS

### Key Technical Features

1. **Complex State Management**
   - Managed 100 independent entity states simultaneously
   - Implemented efficient update cycles using React hooks
   - Utilized TypeScript interfaces for type-safe state handling

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch processing for particle effects
   - Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms
   - Throttled event handlers
   - Optimized collision detection
   - Smart re-rendering using React.memo

3. **Animation System**
   - CSS-based animation system for optimal performance
   - Dynamic particle generation and lifecycle management
   - Smooth transitions and visual feedback
   - Efficient memory management for particle effects

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Fluid layouts adapting to viewport size
   - Dynamic scaling of game elements
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Cross-browser compatibility

## Architecture

### Component Structure
